- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development
- Browserify bundling
- jQuery with Bootstrap for styling
- Gulp build that:
-- compiles JSX
-- lints JSX and JS via ESLint
-- bundles JS and CSS files
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder
-- runs a dev webserver
-- opens your browser at the dev URL
-- reloads the browser upon save

- Server-side rendering with React Router 2.x. Having server-side rendering allows you to pre-render the initial state of your components when a user (or search engine crawler) requests a page.
- Integrating Redux with React Router with Redux Simple Router React Router Redux
- Asynchronous Data Fetching on server-side rendering
- Server side authentication + Redirecting for components
- Hot reloading using react-transform-hmr

    :earth_africa: Server side rendering.
    :fire: Extreme live development - hot reloading of client/server source as well as your webpack configuration, with high level of error tolerance.
    :bullettrain_side: express server.
    :cop: Security on the express server using helmet and hpp.
    :eyes: react as the view.
    :twisted_rightwards_arrows: react-router as the router, along with a dynamic routing configuration (i.e. you get code splitting based on your routes).
    ⛑ react-helmet allowing control of the page title/meta/styles/scripts from within your components. Direct control for your SEO needs.
    🖌 Very basic CSS support - it's up to you to extend it into CSS Modules, SASS, PostCSS, Aphrodite etc.
    🏜 Image and Font support.
    :rocket: Full ES2015 support, using babel to transpile where needed.
    :package: Bundling of both client and server using webpack v2.
    :scissors: Client bundle is split by routes.
    :elephant: Long term caching of the client bundle. Thanks to @mjackson for the inspiration from his super cool web-starter project. Check it out!
    :leaves: Tree-shaking, supported by webpack.
    :heavy_check_mark: Type checking via Flow, a beautiful and unobtrusive type framework. NOTE: Flow is a completely optional feature. The flow type annotations get ripped out of the source by the webpack build step. You have no obligation to use flow within your code and can even uninstall the dependency (flow-bin) without breaking the project. I do highly recommend you try it out though.
    🎛 A development and optimized production configuration.
    :wrench: Easy environment configuration via dotenv files.
    :angel: Airbnb's eslint configuration.

# Separate Tools and Libs

[Redux Updeep](https://github.com/algolia/redux-updeep) "enforce immutability, update state with little boilerplate" redux-updeep is a small reducer generator that uses updeep to immutably deep merge partial updates into the reducer's state. It's great for reducing boilerplate in your redux actions and reducers!

[Redux Observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) "easily compose anything async with RxJS" RxJS middleware for action side effects in Redux using "Epics" https://redux-observable.js.org - RxJS 5-based middleware for Redux. Compose and cancel async actions to create side effects and more.

[Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) "forget about prop types, we want real types" Adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality. http://flowtype.org/ **Warning** Flow has a serious defect or faulty design that appears to prevent installation on a Windows computer. Very unprofessional in 2016 to not test a project on the O/S used by 95% of the human population. This project was added based on user-feedback to this list but until this defect is repaired, it's simply not usable.
