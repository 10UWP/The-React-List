### Phenomic

[Phenomic](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic)  😱 Modern static* website generator based on the React and Webpack ecosystem ✨ https://phenomic.io/ 

- [How to setup Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/setup/)
- [Getting started with Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/docs/getting-started/)
- [See who's using Phenomic](https://phenomic.io/showcase/)

[What are the differences with Gatsby?](https://phenomic.io/docs/faq/gatsby/)
- Phenomic will load pages data on demand only so it can be used for website/app with a lot of pages/screen.
- Phenomic offers offline browsing via Service Worker.
- Phenomic uses peer dependencies so you have total control over the dependencies. You will never have to wait to use latest React version if it's compatible with your code and Phenomic requirements (eg: React 0.14 or 15.0, you decide).
- Phenomic does not have any "optional" dependencies as a real dependency. For example, Gatsby has in it's dependencies LESS, Sass and PostCSS (yeah maybe that's too much). By default, Phenomic will just install PostCSS (since it's required in the phenomic-theme-base), but you can remove it (since it will be added in your package.json) and replace with any dependency you want (or none).
- Phenomic is covered by a lot of automated unit, integration and functional tests to avoid bugs and regressions.

[React Cosmos](https://github.com/skidding/react-cosmos) DX tool for designing truly encapsulated React components. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9V2oKK83Kg Cosmos scans your project for React components and loads them inside the Component Playground, enabling you to:
- Render your components under any combination of props and state
- See component states evolve in real-time as you interact with running instances
- Working with Cosmos improves the component design because it surfaces any implicit dependencies. It also forces you to define sane inputs for every component, making them more predictable and easier to debug down the road.

This project is created using [facebookincubator/create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Although it supports deployment to github pages and heroku, it does not feel intuitive just yet, as we need to run lots of commands.  This project is specifically to solve just that, with just 1 command: npm run deploy - This is achieved by using Zeit's awesome [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now/) service. It is fast, easy, and intuitive way of deploying your React app.

[JSX to React](https://github.com/delvallejonatan/jsx-to-react)  JSX to React live compiler http://jsxtoreact.host JSX to React live compiler transforms from an XML-like syntax into native JavaScript.

[babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform/) This Project Is Deprecated  - React Hot Loader 3 is on the horizon, and you can try it today (boilerplate branch, upgrade example). It fixes some long-standing issues with both React Hot Loader and React Transform, and is intended as a replacement for both. The docs are not there yet, but they will be added before the final release. For now, this commit is a good reference.


[atellier](https://github.com/scup/Atellier) The smartest way to share interactive components with your team. http://scup.github.io/atellier/ A React component that works like a preview of other components. An excellent tool to show how your component works and looks with. Easy to install and configure, you can have a router in your project with Atellier and can interact with any component.

### React Misc
- [The React List](https://github.com/10UWP/The-React-List) don't you hate people that use "this" everywhere in object programming as if they are completely lost about where their code exists in space and time? Well this entry is this.TheReactList so now I can properly hate myself and be ready for a Woody Allen movie.

### Plain Old Javascript
- [Frontend Development](https://github.com/dypsilon/frontend-dev-bookmarks) "Front End" has got to be the stupidest name of all time, grates on my nerves like fingernails on a blackboard every time I hear it. Essentially "Stupidity in a Bottle" in terms of encapsulating a definition of the programming of computers. But it's a nice long list...
- [Frontend stuff](https://github.com/moklick/frontend-stuff) Yet another name devised by Darth Vader himself...
- [Javascript Must Watch Videos](https://github.com/bolshchikov/js-must-watch) sensible name anyways
- [Awesome Javascript](https://github.com/sorrycc/awesome-javascript) assuming Awesome refers to the list or list maker since applying it to Javascript would create a paradox that could implode the Universe.
