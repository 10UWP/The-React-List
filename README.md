[React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) React + Redux starter kit / boilerplate with Babel, hot reloading, testing, linting and a working example app, all built in

[react-flux-starter-kit](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-flux-starter-kit) A quick way to get rolling with React and Flux using Browserify and Gulp

- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development
- Browserify bundling
- jQuery with Bootstrap for styling
- Gulp build that:
-- compiles JSX
-- lints JSX and JS via ESLint
-- bundles JS and CSS files
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder
-- runs a dev webserver
-- opens your browser at the dev URL
-- reloads the browser upon save

[reactGo](https://github.com/reactGo/reactGo) Your One-Stop solution for a full-stack app with ES6/ES2015 React.js featuring universal Redux, React Router, React Router Redux Hot reloading, CSS modules, Express 4.x, and multiple ORMs

- isomorphic universal Rendering
- Redux Predictive state containers.
- Server-side rendering with React Router 2.x. Having server-side rendering allows you to pre-render the initial state of your components when a user (or search engine crawler) requests a page.
- Integrating Redux with React Router with Redux Simple Router React Router Redux
- Asynchronous Data Fetching on server-side rendering
- Server side authentication + Redirecting for components
- Hot reloading using react-transform-hmr
- Time travel using Redux-Devtools Chrome Extension
- Webpack for both development and production bundles. It's (in my opinion) the best bundler for JS, CSS, LESS, images, and lots more!
- CSS Modules allows for modular and reusable CSS. Say goodbye to conflicts (most of them) and global scope

[react-universally](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally) A starter kit giving you the minimum requirements for a production ready universal react application.


    :earth_africa: Server side rendering.
    :fire: Extreme live development - hot reloading of client/server source as well as your webpack configuration, with high level of error tolerance.
    :bullettrain_side: express server.
    :cop: Security on the express server using helmet and hpp.
    :eyes: react as the view.
    :twisted_rightwards_arrows: react-router as the router, along with a dynamic routing configuration (i.e. you get code splitting based on your routes).
    ‚õë react-helmet allowing control of the page title/meta/styles/scripts from within your components. Direct control for your SEO needs.
    üñå Very basic CSS support - it's up to you to extend it into CSS Modules, SASS, PostCSS, Aphrodite etc.
    üèú Image and Font support.
    :rocket: Full ES2015 support, using babel to transpile where needed.
    :package: Bundling of both client and server using webpack v2.
    :scissors: Client bundle is split by routes.
    :elephant: Long term caching of the client bundle. Thanks to @mjackson for the inspiration from his super cool web-starter project. Check it out!
    :leaves: Tree-shaking, supported by webpack.
    :heavy_check_mark: Type checking via Flow, a beautiful and unobtrusive type framework. NOTE: Flow is a completely optional feature. The flow type annotations get ripped out of the source by the webpack build step. You have no obligation to use flow within your code and can even uninstall the dependency (flow-bin) without breaking the project. I do highly recommend you try it out though.
    üéõ A development and optimized production configuration.
    :wrench: Easy environment configuration via dotenv files.
    :angel: Airbnb's eslint configuration.
